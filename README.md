## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Import dataset
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Univariate Analysis → distribution of ratings, revenues, genres
   - Bivariate Analysis → budget vs revenue, rating vs votes
   - Multivariate Analysis → correlations between features

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, box plots
   - Heatmaps for correlations
   - Year-wise trends

4. **Insights & Findings**
   - Which genres dominate the industry?
   - Do higher budgets guarantee higher revenues?
